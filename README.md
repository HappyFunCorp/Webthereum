# Webthereum

This repo contains the code (and text) for HappyFunCorp's [Webthereum tutorial](https://happyfuncorp.com/whitepapers/webthereum).

Note that this tutorial uses a specific version of the web3 library, as the latest version released two days after this tutorial was published uses different method signatures (only temporarily, though, as I understand it, until 1.0 is formally released). If you originally accessed an old version of the tutorial, replace the line

`npm install web3`

with

`npm install web3@1.0.0-beta.27`
